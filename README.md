# Rust Quality Mark

This is a riff off the USSR's Quality Mark (znak kachestva): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_quality_mark_of_the_USSR

I used the SVG by Dmitry Maslov as a basis for the Rust version. The original is in the public domain: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Znak_kachestva_2.svg

I edited the original SVG online, using https://vectr.com
I have no affiliation with the above tool, I just found it more featureful and capable than the other online SVG editors I tried, and I didn't want to install an application on my computer just for this.
